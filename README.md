# Standard-Variable-and-Hypothesis-Test

Challenges:

- Confidence interval: A sample of size n = 100 produced the sample mean of X¯ = 16. Assuming the
population standard deviation σ = 3, compute a 95% confidence interval for the population mean
µ.

- Complete remaining questions for Poisson distribution.
